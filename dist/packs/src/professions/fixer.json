This armor not only hardens their physical form against attacks but also blends elements of the digital world into their reality, enhancing their defensive capabilities. With each moment spent in Grid Armor, the fixer’s physical form starts to flicker with static, their voice carries a distorted echo.<br>But as the fixer overextends their stay in Grid Armor, they begin to lose touch with reality. Their form becomes translucent, their movements erratic, as if they are in a state of buffering. This is a process called Fading. When the digital world takes over them, they can struggle to differentiate between the physical and virtual world, causing disorientation and confusion.",
