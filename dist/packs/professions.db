Keepers are in a state of calm, their aura can interact with the ambient memories embedded in areas rich with Notum. This ability allows them to analyze and visualize past events, almost like watching echoes of history. It\u2019s as if the Notum-infused environment retains imprints of significant occurrences, which Keepers can access and interpret.<br>To implement the \"Echoes of Notum\" system effectively, here's a simple list of actions and rules:</p><p><strong>Echo Activation: </strong>The Keeper can spend 5 NP and make a roll based on their Nano Rating or Perception skill.</p><p><strong>Interpreting Echoes: </strong>Upon activation, the Keeper gets vague impressions or fragments of past events. The clarity and detail depend on the success level of their roll and how recent the event being perceived.While attuned to an echo, a Keeper player can perform the following actions:<ul><li><strong>Visualize: </strong>Attempt to see a visual representation of past events.</li><li><strong>Listen: </strong>Try to hear conversations or sounds from the past.</li><li><strong>Analyze: </strong>Use knowledge or skills to interpret the context of the echo.</li><li><strong>Trace: </strong>Follow the echo to its source or strongest point.</li><li><strong>Record: </strong>Make a record of the echo for further analysis or sharing with the team.</li><li><strong>Disengage: </strong>Safely exit the echo to avoid mental strain or misinformation.</li></ul><br>You can attempt the above actions a number of times equal to the success of the roll. Once you have tapped an area you cannot examine the same area again until you give time for the echoes to reform, usually a week later.</p>"}, {"name": "Notum Sentinel Protocol (Downtime)", "description": "<p>During downtime, a keeper can choose to set up a passive surveillance network using Notum-infused nanosensors. The Keepers can deploy these sensors in areas prone to criminal activities or where suspicious activities have been reported. These sensors discreetly monitor for unusual nanoprogram activities or Notum fluctuations indicative of criminal acts, alerting the Keepers to potential issues. This proactive approach allows them to assist local authorities, prevent crimes, and maintain peace.
