It might have slower movement, lower attack power, or limited access to its abilities.<br>Phase 2 (Mid-Encounter): As the encounter progresses, the android begins to sync more closely with the Engineer. Its capabilities start to improve, unlocking more actions per turn or gaining access to advanced skills.<br>Phase 3 (Full Synchronization): After several rounds (e.g., after 3-5 rounds), the android reaches full synchronization. It now operates at peak capacity, gaining significant boosts to its abilities, speed, strength, and access to its full range of skills and functions.<br>Mechanics:<br><br>Synchronization Die: Represent the synchronization level with a die (e.g., d6). Start at 1, and at the end of each round, increase the die by 1. Each number represents a phase of synchronization.<br>Bonuses and Abilities: Each phase confers specific bonuses or abilities to the android. For example, at Phase 3, the android might gain double movement speed or a powerful attack ability. Reset: If the android is deactivated, destroyed, or encounters a significant disruption, synchronization resets, requiring the process to start over.<br><strong>Commanding the Droid in Combat:</strong><br>Issue commands for Attack, Defend, or Special Abilities.<br>Effective within a specific range of the Engineer.<br>Abilities may have cooldowns.<br><br>Neural Synchronization: Engineers require a direct neural link to control their robots. This link allows for precise commands and real-time adjustments, but due to its complexity, an Engineer can maintain synchronization with only one robot at a time.",
