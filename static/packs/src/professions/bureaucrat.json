      "overview": "<p>Bureaucrats are the puppet masters of the corporate and political arenas, using their charm and commanding presence to influence, control, and manipulate friends and foes alike. They are skilled at negotiation, control, and leveraging situations to their advantage with a mix of charisma and calculated strategy.</p>",
      "signature_ability": "Administrative Assistant",
      "signature_description": "<p>To ensure their safety and maintain their influence, Bureaucrats are often assigned bodyguards. These bodyguards are not just for protection; they are a status symbol, representing the Bureaucrat's importance and the value their organization places on them. Additionally, bodyguards serve as a deterrent against potential threats, indicating that any aggression towards the Bureaucrat will be met with formidable resistance.</p><br><p>The bodyguard summoning process is a service provided by a specialized division within the Bureaucrat's corporation. When a Bureaucrat activates the summoning nanoprogram, it sends an encrypted signal to this division's command center. The signal includes the Bureaucrat's location, current threat level, and any specific requirements for the situation.</p><br><p>The division then deploys a bodyguard, either a clone or a robotic agent, equipped with the latest corporate-funded technology. This rapid deployment is often facilitated by the corporation's exclusive grid transport channels, ensuring that their valuable Bureaucrats are never without protection in critical moments.</p><p><strong>In emergencies your droid can take a hit for you sacrificing itself in the process.</strong></p>",
